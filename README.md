# Virtual Tourist
nanodegree's project from Udacity

The project's concept allows users to put pins on the map and show photo albums about that coordinate.

## API
The application uses Flickr's API. [More infos](https://www.flickr.com/services/developer/api/).

## Persistence
There are two feature integrations to persist context, File Manager and Core Data.

## View Code

I am more comfortable using code to create the app's UI instead Interface Builder tools. The lessons use Storyboard. 
Since I used view code in a big project with different developers it is my favorite way because focusing on maintenance and readable statements, in my opinion, is better.
